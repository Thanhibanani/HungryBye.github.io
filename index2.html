        <h3>Save lives with the touch of a button!</h3>
        <p>
            Our solution is to create an application that lets restaurants, hotels and private people
            donate their food surpluses to areas that are affected by hunger on a national basis.
            The app is called HungryBye, and with the touch of a button, you can save lives of people
            around the world.

                <img src="Location.png" height="613" width="312"/>
            </div>
        <p>
            The premise of the app is simple. You enter the app, and you register either yourself or
            your company. On the homepage you will se a donate button. When you click the button,
            you will be navigated to the donation page where you can enter what type of food you are
            donating and in how many quantities. After you are done, press the donate button.
            On the next page you will be asked to send over your location so our delivery drivers
            can arrive at your location to pick up your food. From there, our employees will take
            care of your donations and prepare them for distribution.
